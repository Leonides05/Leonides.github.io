### websites I recommend
Two websites I recommend are Opera GX because while its a browser, it's many unique functions make it perfect for gaming and resource control. https://www.opera.com/gx?utm_content=2198_02afc92c-3a96-49f2-90cc-310d5f1e3ba2&utm_medium=pa&utm_campaign=PWN_US&utm_id=6c961a45b89b4e52a5c2da8a4c5e14ee&utm_source=PWNgames&edition=std-2 The second website I would recommend is Ground News as it helps me determine media bias and get information in its purest form https://ground.news/ .
